This is an ecommerce api app built with django and 
django-rest-framework

This was fun, nothing to fancy, nothing to extreme
just another small increment to my skill level.

Well to set it up make sure you have python, and pip
installed and then run the installation on the requirements.txt

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And have a great day, LMAO.
